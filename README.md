### What I learned

Working on this challenge I felt I started to understand complex responsivness and positioning of components better. The biggest challenge for me this time was figuring out how swapping from a single image on the mobile/desktop-layouts to two images for the desktop layout. This got me thinking more in depth on whether to use the <picture> element or not, how to hide certain images for desktop only and/or mobile/tablets, and so on. I also struggled a bit on how to overlap several components/divs on top of each other, like the background image in the footer, with a color overlay over it. All in all, it was fun figuring out how to approach these challenges within this challenge 🤓👍



### Useful resources

As always, the helpfull mentors on the Discord channel as well as Kevin Powell on youtube is always my go to resources when I get stuck, or need to understand certain concepts better 🙌
